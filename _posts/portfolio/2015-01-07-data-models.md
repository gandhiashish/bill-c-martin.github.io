### Contributions

Out of a team of developers, my primary contributions were:

* Design and implement framework for web services(SOAP/REST)
* Build/update DB2 queries with optimization
* Estimate and assign work to team members
* Reporting overall team status to managers

### Challenges Overcame

 * The biggest challenge was to come up with a data model design that is robust and capable of dealing with large number of data.
 * Another chanllenge was to build a framework for SOAP and REST web services so that with minimum effort we can consume services provided by other internal teams.
