### Project Description

E-note preprocessor is a multithreaded batch job developed in JAVA using Spring Framework.

The goal was to reduce overhead for E-note processing by filtering out bad records that fail business validations.

### Contributions

my contributions were:

* Created multithreaded batch job
* Developed business rule validations
* Implemented Data Access Objects(DAO) to interface with MySQL and DB2
* Filter out bad records by setting error status for them

### Challenges Overcame

The biggest challenge was that this was the first time I was working with Spring Framework

### Accomplishments

The overhead on E-note process is reduced and the process is processing more records then it used to.

The skills I developed most were:

* Multithreading
* Scalability
* Service-oriented architecture focus
* Spring Framework
